        Contains the ipython notebook for submission of the homework
  ----> make_dataset.py
        Script to populate the training and validation data based on the
        specifications
  ----> verify_dataset.py
        Verifies that the number of samples are as per specification and
        that there are no matching samples in the training and validation
        data folders.

The fine tuned network gets upto 97.5% - 98% accuracy on the validation data.
Towards the end, it has definitely started overfitting.
Some correct and incorrect samples are visualized to give a better idea about
the performance of the network.
